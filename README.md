Global Pathways AI: Transparency-First Decision Engine
Vision/Mission
Addressing the $50,000 annual loss caused by fragmented data and commission-driven career counseling. This project provides a modular, data-driven framework to help users decide between local career growth or international pathways on an individualized basis.

🛠️ System Architecture
Unlike standard "user-pleasing" AI, this system uses a Dual-Layer Architecture to ensure unbiased outcomes:

The Audit Lab (Streamlit/Python):

Data Grounding: Anchors decisions in verified 2026 PPP and economic indices to solve information fragmentation.
Logic: Calculates a 5-year Net Present Value (NPV) comparing local 8% growth against relocation overheads.
Bias Mitigation: A hard-coded Constraint-Satisfaction check that flags high-risk financial paths regardless of university commissions.

The User MVP (Flutter/Dart):
Personalization: Ingests user-specific liquidity and career constraints.
Explainable AI (XAI): Provides a Transparency Score and interpretability layer for every recommendation.

🧪 AI & Analytics Approach

Deterministic ROI Engine: Replaces black-box scoring with transparent financial modeling.
Adversarial-Style Auditor: A secondary validation layer that prevents "unnecessary relocation" recommendations.
Modular Pipeline: Decoupled frontend and backend for horizontal scalability.

📂 Project Structure

/streamlit_engine: Python backend for data processing and bias auditing.
/flutter_app: Mobile MVP for user-facing decision support.
/data: Merged datasets from verified market streams.
